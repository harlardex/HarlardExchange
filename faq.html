            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <h3>Q: What is Harlardex Exchange?</h3>
            <p>A: Harlardex is a secure cryptocurrency exchange where users can buy, sell, and trade a wide range of digital assets. We offer spot trading, limit orders, and fiat on/off-ramps (where available).</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: How do I create an account?</h3>
            <p>A: Click JOIN US NOW on our homepage, enter your email, enter your phone number, choose a strong password, and confirm your password. For full trading access, complete identity verification (KYC).</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: Is there a minimum age to open an account?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes. You must be at least 18 years old (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) to register.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Account & verification</h2>
            <h3>Q: Why does Harlardex require identity verification (KYC)? </h3>
            <p>A: KYC helps us comply with financial regulations, prevent fraud, and protect our users. Verification allows higher withdrawal limits and access to all features.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: What documents do you accept for verification?</h3>
            <p>A: Government-issued ID (passport, national ID card, driver's license) and a selfie or proof of address (utility bill or bank statement) for enhanced verification.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: How long does verification take?</h3>
            <p>A: Most verifications are processed within 24-72 hours. In some cases it may take longer if additional review is needed.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: Can I trade before verifying my account?</h3>
            <p>A: You can explore the platform and make limited crypto-to-crypto trades, but fiat deposits, withdrawals, and higher limits require KYC.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <h3>Q: How does Harlardex keep my funds safe?</h3>
            <p>A: We use industry-standard security measures including cold storage for the majority of funds, encrypted databases, regular security audits, and strict internal controls.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: What security features should I enable? </h3>
            <p> A: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy), set a strong password, and activate withdrawal whitelists for addresses you trust.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: What should I do if I suspect my account is compromised?</h3>
            <p>A: Immediately change your password, disable API keys, remove authorized devices, and contact support at support@harlardex.com.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Deposits & withdrawals</h2>
            <h3>Q: Which deposit methods are supported?</h3>
            <p>A: We support crypto deposits for all listed assets. Where supported in your country, we offer fiat deposits via bank transfer, card, and third-party payment providers.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: How long do cryptocurrency deposits take to appear?</h3>
            <p>A: Deposit times depend on the blockchain network and required confirmations. For example, Bitcoin may take multiple block confirmations; smaller networks can be near-instant.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: Are there deposit or withdrawal fees?</h3>
            <p>A: Harlardex charges competitive trading and withdrawal fees. Fees vary by asset and payment method — check the Fees & Limits page for up-to-date details.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: What are withdrawal limits?</h3>
            <p>A: Withdrawal limits depend on your account verification level. Verified accounts have higher limits. See your account dashboard for your current limits.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Trading & fees</h2>
            <h3>Q: What order types are available?</h3>
            <p>A: We support Market orders, Limit orders, and Stop orders (where applicable). Advanced order types may be available in our trading interface.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: How are trading fees calculated?</h3>
            <p>A: Fees are usually calculated as a percentage of the trade value. Makers (orders that add liquidity) often pay lower fees than takers (orders that remove liquidity). See the Fees & Limits page for details.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: Do you offer margin or derivatives trading?</h3>
            <p> A: Margin and derivatives are not available by default. If we roll out these products, they will be announced on our blog and require additional verification and risk acknowledgment.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Tokens & listings</h2>
            <h3>Q: How does Harlardex exchange decide which tokens to list?</h3>
            <p>A: Token listings are based on security reviews, legal compliance, community interest, liquidity expectations, and technical compatibility.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: Can I request a token listing?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes. Use the List Request form in our Support section. Submitting a request does not guarantee listing</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: Are newly listed tokens risky?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes — newly listed tokens can be volatile and riskier due to low liquidity and limited historical data. Always do your own research (DYOR).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Compliance & legal</h2>
            <h3>Q: Is Harlardex regulated?</h3>
            <p> A: Harlardex complies with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. Regulatory status may vary regionally — consult our Legal page for specific information.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Q: How do you handle tax reporting?</h3>
            <p> A: Users are responsible for reporting taxable events. We provide transaction history and downloadable reports to help with tax reporting. Consult a tax professional for advice.</p>
